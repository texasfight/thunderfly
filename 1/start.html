<!-- This is the body of the webpage. It holds all the stuff you actually see on the page. Some common tags often used in the body, for reference:
    h1: Title. Goes up to h6 for 6 different kinds.
    p: paragraph
    a: link
    img: image
    ul: unordered (bulleted) list
    ol: ordered (numbered) list
    li: list element
    If you want to do something in particular, most of it is online. For example, forms are a little tricky, so I just google "HTML form" and copypaste if I need one.
    I'd show a form, but we'd need to send the data to a server, which we don't have.
